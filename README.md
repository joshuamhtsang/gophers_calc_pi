# gophers_calc_pi
Golang to compute the value of Pi

# Module setup
Thi is my first golang project, so more details that usual.

Since workspace and setting `GOPATH` will be deprecated in Go 1.17, I will use `go mod` to create a 'go.mod' file:
```
$ go mod init github.com/joshuamhtsang/gophers_calc_pi
```
